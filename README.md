# clicker of adrics

this is a simple game where you click an adric. i was really bored so my genius friend said i should make this adaptation so props to him. turns out it was a pretty good test of my speed programming. also turned out to be my actually last actual project made in raw html, css and js. i have since moved on to next.js, react, node.js, all that bollocks. but im keeping this for archival purposes. you can play it [here](https://adricklicker.mrtin.co)
